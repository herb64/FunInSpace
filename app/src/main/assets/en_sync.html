    <h1>Syncing with Herb's dropbox</h1>
    <p>The daily images from NASA are only available on the specific day. If you do not collect the
        image today, the next day a new image will be presented and you might miss this image. The
        option "Get daily info in background" allows to get metadata in background to avoid loss
        of images. But it does not help, if your phone is switched off.</p>
    <p>The sync option allows you to sync contents with a collection of historical content stored
    on my dropbox. This does not store the images itself, but just a list of these images.
    You can select to resync your content with this information. FunInSpace will get this list and
    load any missing images in the list, not on your phone, from NASA.</p>
    <p>This resync has already been done at initial installation, if you did choose to sync contents.</p>
    <p>Your own content is not changed (i.e. your personal ratings are kept). Images,
    that you did delete, are not restored. Only new images</p>
    <p>Note, that the content is not guaranteed to contain all images, also it is not updated on a
    daily basis.</p>
