    <h1>Using wallpapers</h1>
    <p>With Fun In Space you can create wallpapers for your phone background from your favourite
    images. The following features are available</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Define an image range matching display format</li>
        <li>Remove wallpaper</li>
        <li>Shuffle between several images</li>
        <li>Select times at which shuffle happens</li>
    </ul>

    <p>TODO: link to howto-video here as well</p>

    <h2 id="wp_define">Defining a wallpaper</h2>
    <p>While watching the image in fullscreen, just <b>long click</b> on the image. A selection rectangle appears, as shown below:</p>
    <p><img src="wp_select.png" alt="spaceitem" border="1" style="padding:1px; border-width:1px; border-color:Grey;"></p>
    <br style="clear:both" />
    <p>This rectangle has the aspect ratio of your screen and you can move it over the image to select
    the range that should be set as wallpaper background on your phone.</p>
    <p>Once you are done, just do <b>another long click</b> on the image to confirm your selection.</p>
        <p>After returning from the image view with the back button, you are
    asked if you want this selection to be set as your new active wallpaper immediately. If you answer
    no, the wallpaper will just be kept for later activation.</p>
    <p>The thumbnail displays the new wallpaper status in the lower right edge:</p>
    <p><img src="wallpaper_gray.png" alt="cache" style="width:24px;height:24px;margin-right:15px;">A wallpaper exists for this image</p>
    <p><img src="wallpaper_yellow.png" alt="cache" style="width:24px;height:24px;margin-right:15px;">This is the active wallpaper</p>

    <h2 id="shuffle">Using the shuffle function</h2>
    <p><b>Shuffle</b> automatically changes the background image with a random image selected from your
    stored wallpapers. The app does not need to be running. This is by default switched off</p>
    <p>Shuffle can be enabled in the <a href="en_settings.html#shuffle">settings dialog</a>.
        In addition, you can select the full hours, at which shuffles should happen.</p>
    <p>Note, that shuffle is only available with Android 5 and above.</p>
