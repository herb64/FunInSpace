    <h1>General Settings</h1>
    <p><b>Load Hires/Video with Wifi only</b></p>
    <p>This setting defines, if images or videos should be loaded only, if a Wifi connection is
    available. By default, this is switched on to save traffic.</p>
    <p id="localcopy"><b>Save Hires Images locally</b></p>
    <p>By default, this is switched off, so that on each image view, the image data is loaded via
    network from NASA. You can switch on this option to save a local copy of the image.</p>
    <p><b>Used Memory for Hires images</b></p>
    <p>If storing images on your phone, this can consume quite a lot of memory, especially because
    the images from NASA can be very large. With this setting, you decide, how many percent of the
    currently available space can be used. After each view of an image, <i>Fun in Space</i> does
    perform a cleanup. If available free space has shrunk for any reason (also if other apps did
    consume more memory), the app does a deletion of images, depending on their size and the
    rating you have set. The small symbol on the lower left of the thumbnail is removed for those
    images, for which the local copy has been removed, indicating, that this will be loaded from
    network the next time (which might cause other images to be removed)</p>
    <p id="shuffle"><b>Wallpaper Shuffle</b></p>
    <p>This is disabled by default. If you switch this on, <i>Fun In space</i> begins to shuffle
    your phone background with a random selected wallpaper from those images, for which you have
    defined a wallpaper selection.</p>
    <p><b>Wallpaper Shuffle Times</b></p>
    <p>These are the times, at which shuffle will take place.</p>
    <p><b>Wallpaper Image Quality</b></p>
    <p>to describe</p>
    <p><b>Get daily info in background</b></p>
    <p>NASA only provides the daily info for an image at the given day. On the next day, a new information
    is available. This means, if you do not run the app on a certain day, you might loose that image.
    (The planned archive search might come in here...). This option makes sure, that even if you
    don't start the app for several days, <i>Fun In Space</i> tries to get the daily information
    in background (provided your phone is switched on). On the next start, all missed infos are
    checked and missing thumbnails are created.</p>
    <p>Note, that the switchover to the new image takes place at 00:00 NASA server time, which is in
    Timezone New York. This means, that availability of the image depends on our timezone. The image might appear in the afternoon,
    if you are located in Japan.</p>
    <p><b>Play sound on background load</b></p>
    <p>This is switched off by default. If switched on, a sound is played as soon as a valid APOD
    info has been collected in background. Depending on your timezone, this might happen during the
    night.</p>
    <p><b>Thumbnail color quality</b></p>
    <p>to be described</p>
    <p><b>Read explanation</b></p>
    <p>This allows to read the explanation while watching an image in fullscreen. By default, this
    is disabled.</p>
    <p><b>Date Format</b></p>
    <p>select the date format you like - todo - improve and add more formats</p>
    <p><b>Fallback to lowres (not yet active)</b></p>
    <p>to be done</p>
    <p><b>Full Search</b></p>
    <p>This is disabled by default. The search function can also search the explanation text, if
    this is enabled.</p>
